dataset analysis for 'Using AI to understand how preventative interventions can improve the health of children in the UK and reduce winter pressures on the NHS' (King's College London for HDR UK and NIHR)

- datasets provide distributions for an agent-based model representing individuals during the winter months
- distributions relate to spread of demographics (e.g. SEC and ethnicity), behaviours (e.g. uptake of interventions), environment (e.g. resource ('gas') access) and payoff mapping (e.g. health outcomes).

- datasets include: 
    (1) Lambeth DataNet (LDN)
    (2) eLIXIR
    (3) Resilience, Ethnicity & AdolesCent Mental Health (REACH)
    (4) The Millennium Cohort Study (MCS)
    (5) The Office for National Statistics (ONS)
    (6) UK Government Data
    (7) Data collected at King's College London
- properties (e.g. ethnicity) that are represented in multiple datasets are analysed in `aggregate.ipynb`
